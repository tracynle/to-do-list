# to-do-list
This project was based from CodeExplained's tutorial.

This helped me practice save items using local storage and Javascript to render elements on the page dynamically. 

Items are saved once the user enters their To Do list in the input field. Once it is saved, the user can check, uncheck, or delete the items as well as clear them from local storage.
